# Claude Code Workflow Rules

## Standard Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
- First think through the problem
- Read the codebase for relevant files
- Write a plan to `tasks/todo.md`

### 2. Create Todo List
- The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
- Keep tasks specific and actionable

### 3. Verification
- Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan
- Wait for approval before proceeding

### 4. Implementation
- Begin working on the todo items
- Mark them as complete as you go
- Work incrementally through the list

### 5. Communication
- Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
- Keep explanations clear and concise

### 6. Simplicity First
- Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible
- We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes
- Every change should impact as little code as possible
- Everything is about simplicity

### 7. Review and Documentation
- Finally, add a review section to the `todo.md` file with:
  - A summary of the changes you made
  - Any other relevant information
  - Lessons learned or important notes

## Key Principles
- **Incremental progress**: Small, manageable changes
- **Clear communication**: Explain what you're doing
- **Simplicity**: Keep it simple, avoid complexity
- **Documentation**: Track progress and changes
- **Collaboration**: Check in before major decisions
